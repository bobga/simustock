# simustock

Features:
- Hook application up to an already developed RESTful api (I developed the api so expect to collaborate with me)

- Data for the app will come from my RESTful API and data generated with the app will be stored in my database with the API

- Enable account creation and authentication for users using Auth0 and my API (because the backend is secured with Auth0)

- Ensure that a user can be identified after logging in with Auth0

- Provide screen for account settings to be changed

- Provide a screen to show the userâ€™s item accounts

- Provide a page to enable users to search items and create new item accounts from a specific item
